# karma-jasmine-typescript-boilerplate

Executes the same unit tests against the same code on a browser as well as Node.js.

Includes built-in support for WebKit, Chrome, and Firefox.

This repository serves as a proof-of-concept and nothing more.

Portions of this were borrowed from:

- https://github.com/piecioshka/boilerplate-jasmine-typescript (for Node.js configuration)
- https://github.com/monounity/karma-typescript/tree/master/packages/karma-typescript (for Karma / browser configuration)


## Running Tests

Note, the default configuration runs the same tests across the environments you choose.

**Browser and Node tests:**

```sh
$ npm run test
```

**Browser-only tests:**

```sh
$ npm run test:browser
```

**Node-only tests:**

```sh
$ npm run test:node
```

## Configuration

To update the configuration, modify the relevant file(s) for your environment(s):

- Node.js: [jasmine.node.json](jasmine.node.json)
- Browser: [karma.conf.js](karma.conf.js)
